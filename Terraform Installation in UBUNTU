Here’s an explanation for each command in the Terraform installation process on Ubuntu/Debian:

---

 1. Update system & install required packages

bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl


* sudo apt-get update: Updates the package index (list of available packages and their versions).
* sudo apt-get install -y ...: Installs the required packages:

  * gnupg: Required to handle GPG keys.
  * software-properties-common: Adds extra functionalities like managing apt repositories.
  * curl: Tool to download data from URLs.

---

 2. Download and save the HashiCorp GPG public key

bash
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
gpg --dearmor | \
sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null


* wget -O- URL: Downloads the GPG key and outputs it to stdout.
* gpg --dearmor: Converts the GPG key from ASCII to binary format.
* sudo tee ... > /dev/null: Saves the key to a secure system location used by apt. > /dev/null suppresses the output.

---

 3. Verify the key fingerprint

bash
gpg --no-default-keyring \
--keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
--fingerprint


* Checks the fingerprint of the saved GPG key to ensure it’s authentic.
* --no-default-keyring: Uses only the specified keyring.
* --keyring: Specifies the keyring file to use.
* --fingerprint: Prints the key fingerprint to verify it's the correct one.

 4. Add the official HashiCorp APT repository

bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(grep -oP '(?<=UBUNTU_CODENAME=).*' /etc/os-release || lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list


* dpkg --print-architecture: Detects your system’s architecture (e.g., amd64).
* grep -oP ... || lsb_release -cs: Gets the codename of your Ubuntu version (e.g., jammy, focal).
* Adds HashiCorp’s repository to your system's list so you can install Terraform directly with apt.

---

 5. Update package index again to include HashiCorp repo

bash
sudo apt update


* Refreshes your package list to include the newly added HashiCorp repository.

---

 6. Install Terraform

bash
sudo apt-get install terraform


* Installs the latest version of Terraform from the official HashiCorp repo.
